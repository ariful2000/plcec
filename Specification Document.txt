Specification Document

Rules for all literal values:
'=', '+', '-', '/', '*', '(', ')', ',', ';'
these are the literals 
doing basic operations
Description of every data type that is provided with the language
we have data types, if (condition), else(condition), 
for(top use loop), fun (method)
eqeq(equal equal), then.

Rules for how variables are created, operated upon, expressed, and evaluated
we can assign variable by simply typing a character (a,b or anything)
for example a = 5 
b = 7, a + b = 12
Rules for the control structures:
	For control flow we are using simple if statement 
	and we are using for loop for looping
Functions/methods/subprograms and the rules around them
here we can use functions without parameters.
then we use the arrow keyword
then we can use if, else, for
for x = 0 to 100 
then if x == 10
then x * 200 
else x 
to call the function we can write functiontest()

Keywords and Special symbols and all of their function
given in the code. they all are doing basic operations
Semantics for each syntax rule that is defined.
Instructions of how to create valid code.
to create valid code:
x = 20
if x == 20,
then x = x * 2 
else x = x * 5
Here x is 20, so output is 40 (x * 2) 
output x = 40
